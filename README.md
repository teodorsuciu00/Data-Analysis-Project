ðŸ§  Business Scenario: Executive Sales & Profitability Insights Dashboard
Background: AdventureWorks is a global manufacturing company that sells products both online and through resellers. 
Executives and managers need a centralized dashboard to make data-driven decisions. 
Right now, they donâ€™t have a single report that answers key business questions efficiently.

## ðŸ“Š Business Need:
"We need a dashboard that gives us a clear view of overall sales performance, profit trends, and regional dynamicsâ€”broken down by product category, reseller channel, and time (month/quarter/year). We also want to identify our most profitable products and regions, and spot trends like seasonality or declining performance."
