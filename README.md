## ðŸ§  Business Scenario: Executive Sales & Profitability Insights Dashboard
Background: AdventureWorks is a global manufacturing company that sells products both online and through resellers. 
Executives and managers need a centralized dashboard to make data-driven decisions. 
Right now, they donâ€™t have a single report that answers key business questions efficiently.

## ðŸ“Š Business Need:
We need a dashboard that gives us a clear view of overall sales performance, profit trends, and regional dynamicsâ€”broken down by product category, reseller channel, and time (month/quarter/year). We also want to identify our most profitable products and regions, and spot trends like seasonality or declining performance.

## ðŸ§© Key Questions to Answer in the Report:
### 1. What are the total sales and profit by year and month?
#### Overall Insights:
- The business has generated $45.9M in total sales and $18.98M in profit, maintaining an average profit margin of 41.34%.
- 91,713 total orders have been processed, indicating a significant volume of transactions over time.
#### Yearly Trends:
- 2025 (so far) shows the highest profit margin (55.92%), but total sales and orders are lower compared to previous years. This could indicate a shift toward selling higher-margin products or reduced operational costs.
- 2024 was the strongest year in terms of revenue, with $25.8M in total sales and 80,817 orders. However, the profit margin (41.41%) is close to the overall average.
- 2023 had a slightly higher profit margin (42.11%) than 2024, but with significantly fewer orders (5,786), suggesting that either fewer but more profitable products were sold or there were pricing changes.
- 2022 had the lowest profit margin (40.31%), and sales volume was the lowest among full years, indicating either increased costs or lower pricing strategies.
#### Key Takeaways:
- 2024 was the best-performing year in terms of sales volume and total profit.
- 2025 is showing a promising increase in profit margin, suggesting better profitability strategies.

### 2. Which product categories bring the most revenue and profit?
#### Overall Insights:
- The sales distribution across categories is highly imbalanced, with bikes dominating both revenue and quantity of sales, while accessories have the highest profit margin.
#### Key Insights:
- Bikes account for nearly all sales (96.38%), making them the companyâ€™s primary revenue driver. However, their profit margin (40.86%) is lower than accessories.
- Accessories have the highest profit margin (62.60%), suggesting that they contribute significantly to profitability despite lower sales volume.
- Clothing has the lowest revenue and quantity of sales, and its profit margin (39.99%) is slightly lower than that of bikes.
#### Key Takeaways:
- Since bikes generate most of the revenue, maintaining or expanding this category is crucial.
- Investing in accessories could be a high-margin opportunity, as they bring the highest profitability relative to revenue.
